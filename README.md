# Spring Logger Lab 1

## Instruction

Add proper logging to all your existing endpoints in your Spring
application in this lab:

1. For each method in your Spring application, add a `logger.trace()` at the
   beginning of the method and a `logger.trace()` call at the end of the method.
2. For each result that you get from an external API, add a `logger.info()` to
   indicate that you got a result and include one data item from the response
   you received.
